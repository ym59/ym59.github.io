      <h3>So, what just rolled into the neighborhood</h3>
      <p>
        Every now and then, the Solar System gets a visitor from far, far away. 3I/ATLAS is the latest interstellar comet cruising through like it owns the place. 
        It’s not staying, it’s not orbiting the Sun forever, it’s just passing through, and that alone makes it fascinating. 
        This is cosmic mail from another star system.
      </p>

      <h3>Why this is quietly a big deal</h3>
      <p>
        Interstellar comets are chemical time capsules. They tell us what kind of cosmic soup swirled around distant stars when their planets were forming. 
        Watching this one means more data, better models, and fewer guesses in planetary science. As Bill Nye says, “Science rules.” 
        Sometimes, ruling just looks like someone pointing a very expensive telescope at a dot.
      </p>

      <h3>The boring (but important) visibility part</h3>
      <p>
        This isn’t a Great Comet moment. It’s not going to light up the night sky, no matter how romantically I wish it would. 
        It’s faint — the kind of faint that makes astrophotographers post about tracking precision and signal-to-noise ratios. 
        My telescope isn’t nearly fancy enough to catch it, so like many of us, I’ll be waiting for NASA or ESA to drop a passable glamour shot while I rest my photography ambitions in peace.
      </p>

      <h3>Why astronomers are buzzing anyway</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They get to watch the comet’s chemistry reveal itself as it warms.</li>
        <li>They’ll measure light curves, tail dynamics, and composition.</li>
        <li>They’ll compare it to its famous cousins, ʻOumuamua and Borisov.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For planetary scientists, this isn’t background noise, it’s prime time!
      </p>

      <h3>The tiny tinfoil hat corner</h3>
      <p>
        When an interstellar object shows up, someone somewhere always whispers “what if it’s not natural.” 
        It happened with ʻOumuamua, it’ll happen again. Phil Plait once quipped that reality is usually cooler than conspiracy, and I agree. 
        This is a rock, a dusty, icy, beautifully alien rock.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        TL;DR: It’s faint. It’s far. It’s fantastic science. 
        Interstellar comets aren’t here to dazzle Instagram, they’re here to help us understand where worlds come from.
      </div>

      <p class="footnote">
        I’ll be cheering from a warm rooftop in India while waiting for the space agencies to share their shots. 
        The big telescopes can have the glory. I’ll take the thrill of watching the story unfold.
      </p>
