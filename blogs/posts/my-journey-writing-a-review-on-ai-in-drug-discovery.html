    <h1>My Journey Writing a Review on AI in Drug Discovery</h1>
    <div class="meta">Published: Aug 22, 2025 • Author: Yash Mathur</div>

    <div class="content">
      
      <h3>The innocent idea that became a marathon</h3>
      <p>
        The plan was simple. Write a short, clean review on AI in drug discovery. 
        Consolidate the latest advancements. Provide a nice, readable overview. 
        The kind of thing that sounds reasonable over coffee and then turns into an eight-month intellectual marathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The field is enormous. Every subdomain spawns ten more. 
        Instead of narrowing the focus like sensible people, we aimed to cover the landscape. 
        It was a bold choice and, in hindsight, a slightly reckless one.
      </p>

      <h3>When the search engine turned into a tidal wave</h3>
      <p>
        A first-pass search for “AI” and “drug discovery” brought back more than 50,000 results. 
        That number is not inspiring. It is terrifying. 
        Through several rounds of filtering, we carved it down to about 500 key papers, each one waiting to be read, understood, and woven into a bigger story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organization became survival. A gigantic Excel sheet became my anchor, with every paper slotted by application, method, and relevance. 
        <strong>Semantic Scholar</strong> and <strong>Elicit</strong> made high-level triage bearable. 
        <strong>Research Rabbit</strong> was my guilty pleasure, because citation graphs are strangely addictive.
      </p>

      <h3>The strange comfort of digital clutter</h3>
      <p>
        My setup reflected a split personality. 
        <strong>EndNote</strong> managed citations with military precision. 
        <strong>Obsidian</strong> was pure chaos, filled with half-baked thoughts, loose ideas, and references I swore I’d organize later. 
        Somewhere in between, the actual paper began to take shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        One insight stood out as the reading pile grew. 
        Excellence is not confined to glossy journals. 
        Some of the most creative, rigorous work sat on <strong>arXiv</strong>, patiently waiting for peer review while already contributing meaningfully to the field.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding the narrative</h3>
      <p>
        Writing a review is not just about summarizing papers. It is about finding the threads that connect them. 
        In AI-driven drug discovery, those threads ran through target identification, hit generation, lead optimization, and ADMET prediction. 
        The literature was diverse, but the story emerged once I mapped how different methods were quietly talking to each other.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        Review papers live or die on structure. 
        Without it, even the best content is just a pile of smart words.
      </div>

      <h3>The quiet victories</h3>
      <p>
        There were no big cinematic breakthroughs here. 
        Just many small wins. A better way to group the papers. A figure that finally made sense. A section that stopped sounding like a tax form. 
        Slowly, the chaos turned into something coherent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, the process was exhausting but strangely satisfying. 
        It reminded me that science is as much about the architecture of thought as it is about the content itself.
